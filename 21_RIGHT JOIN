The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.

//RIGHT JOIN Syntax:
SELECT ColumnNames
FROM Table1
RIGHT JOIN Table2 
ON Table1.ColumnName = Table2.ColumnName;

The following SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they might have placed:
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;

Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).

Q. Choose the correct JOIN clause to select all the records from the Customers table plus all the matches in the Orders table.
SELECT *
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
