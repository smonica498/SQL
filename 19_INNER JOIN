//INNER JOIN Syntax:
SELECT ColumnNames

The following SQL statement selects all the orders with Customer and Shipper information:
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);

Q. Choose the correct JOIN clause to select all records from the two tables where there is a match in both tables.
SELECT *
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
