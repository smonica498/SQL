Aliases is used to give a table or a column in a table a temporary name
Note: double quotation marks or square brackets are used if AliasName contains a space in betwwen

//Alias Column Syntax:
SELECT ColumnName AS AliasName
FROM TableName;

//Alias Table Syntax:
SELECT ColumnName
FROM TableName AS AliasName;

The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS [Customer Name]
FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):
SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ', ' + City + ', ' + Country + ', ' AS Address
FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). 
We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively:
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Orders as o, Customers as c
WHERE o.OrderName = 'Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;

Q. When displaying the Customers table, make an ALIAS of the PostalCode column, the column should be called Pno instead.
SELECT CustomerName,
Address,
PostalCode AS Pno
FROM Customers;

Q. When displaying the Customers table, refer to the table as Consumers instead of Customers.
SELECT * FROM Customers AS Consumers;
