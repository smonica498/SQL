A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

The following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that have matching values in both tables:
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

Types of SQL Joins:
(Inner) Join - returns records that have matching values in both tables (A intersection B)
Left (Outer) Join - returns all the records from the Left table and the matching records from the right table (A)
Right (Outer) Join - returns all the records from the right table and the matching records from the left table (B)
Full (Outer) Join - returns all the records when there is a match in either left or right table (A union B)

Q. Insert the missing parts in the JOIN clause to join the two tables Orders and Customers, using the CustomerID field in both tables as the relationship between the two tables.
SELECT *
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
